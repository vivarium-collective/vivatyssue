Tissue closure / fusion events
==============================

Behaviors that close an open monolayer (e.g. the rim of a lifting tissue or
two fronts coming into contact) into a continuous epithelium with a lumen.

These events bundle the topology operations needed for closure:

- the local rearrangements (T1 / IH and T3 / HI transitions) that progressively
  squeeze cells away from the boundary -- the "zipper" mechanism, and
- the lateral-face fusion operation
  (:func:`tyssue.topology.bulk_topology.fuse_lateral_faces`) that welds two
  apposed free lateral walls into one internal interface. It is collision-
  triggered (nucleation on distance + facing angle, propagation on the fold
  angle of an existing seam) and polarity-typed (apical-to-apical, basal-to-
  basal), so no coincidence between whole faces is required and a basal face can
  never fuse to a lateral one. When two fusions trap an unequal number of cells
  between them (a wide wall apposed to two narrower ones -- a "2-vs-1 pocket"),
  the wide wall is split (:func:`tyssue.topology.bulk_topology.find_fusion_splits`)
  so the pocket can finish zipping shut.

The events are deliberately kept out of the solver's ``auto_reconnect`` path:
add them to an :class:`~tyssue.behaviors.event_manager.EventManager` manually,
e.g. ``manager.append(lumen_closure, **spec)``, while experimenting.

    This is the pure fusion step: it performs no rearrangement, only the
    lateral-face fusion of fronts that have come into contact (nucleation where
    two fronts first meet, propagation along an existing seam). It re-appends
    itself to the manager so it keeps watching for new contacts every step.

    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------
    d_max : float or None
        contact distance from a vertex to the opposing face plane for
        nucleation. Defaults to ``eptm.settings["fusion_distance"]`` (or the
        mean free lateral-edge length).
    theta_face : float, default 45.0
        maximum deviation, in degrees, from anti-parallel alignment of the two
        walls' normals for nucleation.
    theta_fold : float, default 20.0
        fold-angle threshold, in degrees, below which two edge-sharing flaps are
        considered closed onto each other (propagation).
    margin : float, default 0.5
        lateral-containment tolerance for nucleation (fraction of face radius).
    segment : str, default "lateral"
        the segment of free faces eligible to fuse.

    Each step this event

       cells together, then
