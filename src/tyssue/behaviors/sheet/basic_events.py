    Nothing in a vertex model's energy resists a face passing through itself: face
    area is a sum of *unsigned* sub-triangle areas, so a fold contributes positive
    area and the area elasticity feels no restoring force, while ``reconnect`` only
    reacts to *short edges*. A fold is therefore silent and permanent unless
    something looks for it, which is what this does.

    It only reports -- it never modifies the mesh. Repair belongs to a callback.

    kwargs overwrite their corresponding ``sheet.settings`` entries.

    Keyword Arguments
    -----------------
    every : int, default 1
        run the detection every ``every``-th step, re-appending itself in between.
        The full check costs ~14 ms on a 750-cell sheet, so ``every=1`` adds ~17
        minutes to a 72,000-step run; a fold develops over hundreds of steps, so
        ``every=10`` or more loses nothing in practice.
    strict : bool, default False
        also run the pairwise face-overlap test, which catches a "lens" overlap in
        which two faces cross without either one's vertex landing inside the other.
        The only test whose cost is not negligible.
    trigger : {None, "folded"}, default None
        ``"folded"`` only looks for contained vertices around faces that are
        already self-crossing, which is much cheaper. Sound only where every
        intrusion comes from a folded face -- true of the crypt (measured 62/62)
        but NOT a theorem: two convex cells can slide through each other with
        neither ring self-crossing.
    raise_on_detect : bool, default False
        raise ``IntersectionError`` on the first defect, to stop a run at the step
        it goes wrong rather than at the end.
    on_detect : callable, optional
        called as ``on_detect(sheet, report)`` whenever a defect is found.
    max_span_rad : float, optional
        faces whose surface normal turns by more than this across the face are
        reported as *undecidable* instead of folded, because no plane represents
        them. Defaults to 30 degrees.
    history : list, optional
        a list to append ``(sheet.settings.get("time"), report)`` to each step.

    The most recent report is always left on ``sheet.settings["intersections"]``.
